## 🎯 The Problem This Solves

**Your Challenge:**
- Google forces "Vehicle Repair Shop" category (can't use "Mobile Mechanic" in UK)
- Can't hide your address
- Limited to 5-10 mile Google Maps radius
- Don't appear in searches for towns you actually serve

**The Solution:**
- **Location pages** rank in organic search for each target city
- **Enhanced schema** tells Google your full service area
- **GBP optimization** (Posts, Q&A, Services) extends your reach
- **Multi-channel strategy** builds location authority across the web

## ⚡ Critical Action Required

### ⚠️ URGENT: Fix Phone Number Inconsistency

Your site has two different phone numbers:
- Schema markup: `07930991598`
- Brand constants: `07354915941`

**You must:**
1. Determine which number is correct
2. Update `index.html` line 39 with the correct number
3. Update Google Business Profile
4. Update all directories and social media

**Why this matters:** Google uses phone number consistency as a ranking signal. Inconsistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) data hurts local SEO.

## 🚨 Important Reminders

### Do NOT Do (Google Violations)

## 💡 Why This Will Work

**Google's algorithm looks for location relevance signals:**

1. **Content signals** → Location pages with city-specific content
2. **Schema signals** → Structured data listing service areas
3. **Citation signals** → Directory listings confirming coverage
4. **Review signals** → Customers mentioning specific locations
5. **Engagement signals** → Posts and Q&A about locations

**You're building ALL of these signals across multiple channels.**
